    <h2>The Story Behind the Album</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>“Always...Maybe”</strong> is the most personal project I’ve ever created. It’s pop music soaked in emotion honest, and unfiltered. Every song reflects moments from my daily life.  
      <br><br>
      It’s not just an album. It’s a story and the last chapter before I go quiet for a while.
      <br><br>
      A huge part of this project was crafted with <strong>Broox</strong>, a brilliant new voice who didn’t just feature ,she helped shape the entire emotional landscape of the album. Her presence is woven into the sound, the feeling, and the soul of “Always...Maybe.”
